## Instructions

The goal is to submit a pull request that accomplishes the following tasks. While the pull requests are public, don't blindly copy others. The follow up interview will involve questions on your submission.

Fork this repository to begin.

## Challenge 1: 

Your first challenge is to solve an algorithm question. Choose **one** of the following questions to answer. We'll only look at one answer, so don't do more than one. 

### Question A: Return first duplicate

Create a function that accepts an array of integers and returns the first duplicate value. Here's an example:

```swift
let testArray = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 4]

if let duplicate = firstDuplicatedElement(in: testArray) {
  print(duplicate) // prints 4
}
```

Here's a function signature to start you off:

```swift
func firstDuplicatedElement(in array: [Int]) -> Int? {
  // your code here
}
```
